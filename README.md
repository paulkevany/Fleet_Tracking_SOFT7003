# Fleet_Tracking_SOFT7003
3rd Year Group Project - Vehicle Fleet Tracking System

The aim of this project is to create a system that can track a fleet of vehicles. It is loosely based on the Uber concept.
The vehicle position will be tracked using an Arduino and OneSheeld combination. A mobile App will allow a customer to book a ride with one of the driverless vehicles.
An administrator also needs to be able to view all relevant information from an Administrator Panel. 

This is the Admin Panel aspect of the project. It provides Administrators with functionality such as Order Management, User Management, Revenue Reporting and more. It also includes Social Media Login functionality.
