# Fleet_Tracking_SOFT7003
3rd Year Group Project - Vehicle Fleet Tracking System

The aim of this project is to create a system that can track a fleet of vehicles. 
The vehicle position will be tracked using an Arduino and OneSheeld combination. A mobile App will allow a customer to book a ride with one of the driverless vehicles.
An administrator also needs to be able to view all relevant information from an Administrator Panel.
